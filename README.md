# Mirall0x

Mirall0x app is an open source project developed to empower communities when analyzing candidates for grants. It uses  on-chain and off-chain metadata to deliver quality information in a centralized and visual way for key decision making.  

For an explanation of one of the main use cases and a demo of the current app version check this video :

## How does it work?  
  

Broadly, It is built on top of the concept of Legos for sybil analysis, a concept developed by the former Gitcoin's Fraud Detection and Defense Workstream and the [OpenData Community](https://opendatacommunity.org/). Further explanation on legos [here](https://opendatacommunity.org/docs/legos). 
MIrall0x extracts project  data from third party services, treats this data and performs the first layers of calculations. Utilizing ‘weights’ imputed by the user for each ‘behavior’ of a set of  projects, it performs a second layer of calculations resulting in scores for each behavior  and generating an overall score. By the end, projects are displayed in a 3D scatterplot positioned by their score results  to help the user to better visualize ‘riskier’ projects that could be prioritized for further analysis. Optionally, mirall0x provides a CSV file with the legos results and the scores according to  the imputed weights given by the user.
